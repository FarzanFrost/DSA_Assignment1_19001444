Horspool Algorithm

There are two python files named "stringMatching" and "TestData", "stringMatching" file has the code for the algorithm and "TestData" file
has codes to run the test data in the "inputTestData" text file, "TestData" file reads the text file and runs the algorithm and gives output
in the terminal. Even though the code is python, there is no need to run the code in python, I have converted the .py file into .exe file so
that a person with windows can run it without installing python in their computer.

To go through the codes we need to open "stringMatching.py" and "TestData.py" files.

To see the output double click on the "Assignment1_19001444.exe" with the yellow icon. And a terminal will pop up, scroll up to see output
from the beginning. then enter any key to exit the terminal. The output given by this program are the result of 15 test cases.
